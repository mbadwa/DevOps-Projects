## Scenario

We have application services running on physical or virtual machines with various services that powers the application and the workload is in a local data center.

Managing all this on prem will need several teams; Virtualization team, Data Center OPs Team, Monitoring Team, Sys Admin, Security team, etc, involved.

 - **Problem**
  
   - Complex management
   - Scale UP/Down complexity
   - UpFront CapEx & Regular OPEx
   - Most of the processes will be manual
   - Difficult to automate and maintain
   - Time consuming operations
   
- **Solution**
  
  - Implementing a cloud solution that has the following advantages;
    - PayAsUgo
    - PAAS & SAAS services to have low operation overhead
    - IAAC
    - Flexibility/Elasticity (Scale out or  Scale in).
    - Easier to manage infrastructure
    - Automation
  
## AWS Services on this project

**Frontend Services**

- Beanstalk to replace EC2 Instances for Tomcat VM
- Beanstalk to replace Nginx LB
- Beanstalk for Autoscaling services
- S3/EFS Storage for shared storage
  
**Backend Services**

- RDS Instances for MySQL DB
- ELASTICACHE Service to replace MEMCACHED
- ACTIVE MQ to replace RabbitMQ
- Route 53 for private/public DNS service
- Cloudfront for Content Delivery Network (CDN)

**Services Comparison**

- Beanstalk vs Tomcat Ec2/VM
- ELB in Beanstalk vs NGINX LB/ELB
- Autoscaling vs NONE / Autoscaling
- EFS/S3 vs NFS / S3 / EFS
- RDS vs MySQL on VM/EC2
- ELASTICACHE vs MEMCACHED on VM/EC2
- ACTIVE MQ vs RabbitMQ on VM/EC2
- ROUTE 53 vs GODaddy / Local DNS
- Cloudfront vs NONE / Multi DCs Across the world

## The AWS Architecture Design for the Project

- EC2 Instances
- ELB from Beanstalk
- Autoscaling from Beanstalk
- EFS/S3 For Shared Storage
- RDS
- Elasticache
- ActiveMQ
- Cloudfront
- Amazon Certificate Manager
- Route 53

## User Experience Flow

- User(s) will access an HTTPS URL Amazon CloudFront (CDN) endpoint that will be resolved by Route 53, the endpoint will cache so many things to serve global audience, then the request will be redirected to the Beanstalk application load balancer endpoint which in turn forwards the request to an instance in the Beanstalk autoscaling group.
- Amazon CloudWatch alarms will be monitoring the autoscaling group to trigger scale ins and scale outs requirements.
- Artifacts will be saved into an S3 bucket to facilitate ease of deployment.
- The HTTPS certificate will be issued by the Amazon Certificate Manager service.
- The entire frontend will be managed by Amazon Beanstalk.
- Tomcat will allow all accesses to it through its own Security Group.
- Information of backend services i.e. **Elasticache, AmazonMQ, RDS** will be populated in **Amazon Route 53 DNS Private Zones** (replacing the **/etc/hosts** file on premises Linux OS). This will be accessed by the Tomcat services through their private IPs.
- These backend services i.e. **Elasticache, AmazonMQ, RDS** will be in their own security group.

## Flow of Execution

- Log into [AWS Account](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/)
- Create Key Pairs
- Create Security Group for backend services, ie. Elasticache, RDS & ActiveMQ (AmazonMQ)
- Create
  - RDS
  - Amazon Elasticache
  - Amazon ActiveMQ
- Create Elastic Beanstalk Environment
- Update the backend SG to allow traffic the Beanstalk SG that will be automatically provisioned by the Beanstalk environment
- Update the backend SG to allow internal traffic
- Launch an Ec2 Instance for DB Initialization
- Log into the instance and Initialize the RDS DB
- Change healthcheck on the Beanstalk to "/login" as the path
- Add 443 https Listener to the ELB that gets created automatically by the Beanstalk
- Build Artifact from source code with Backend Information i.e. Endpoint of RDS, AmazonMQ and Elasticache
- Deploy Artifact to Beanstalk
- Create CDN using Amazon CloudFront with SSL certificate
- Update entries in GoDaddy and Public DNS Zones in Route 53
- Test the URL
  
### Create a key pair

A key pair is used for ssh authentication when you want to access your resources remotely.

1. Go to **EC2 > Network & Security > Key Pairs** and hit **Create key pair**
2. Enter name **"vprofile-bean-key"** feel free to choose any name, but in keeping the standard that's why the key is given that name.
3. Under Private key file format select **.pem** for Linux or **.ppk** for Windows
4. Hit **Create key pair**
5. Change the key access permissions as per instructions indicated within the console.

# To Be Continued after DNS Replication
### Security Groups Examples in this Project 

1. Load Balancer Security Group - **vprofile-ELB-SG** 
   - Port: 443
   - Protocol: HTTPS - since it's public facing. If you don't have a domain yet, use HTTP.
2. Vprofile app Security Group - **vprofile-app-SG** 
   - Port: 8080 
   - Protocol: HTTP for Tomcat app and allow **vprofile-ELB-SG** so all traffic coming in is allowed to the web application.
   - Port: 22 
   - Protocol: SSH to allow traffic to Tomcat server for troubleshooting using a specific IP.

3. Vprofile Backend Services Security Group - **vprofile-backend-SG**
   - All traffic on all ports with a source of **vprofile-backend-SG** to allow intercommunication among all services within the backend.

### EC2 VM instances setup

1. Clone the source code [here](https://github.com/hkhcoder/vprofile-project.git). If you just want the aws-LiftAndShift branch then download from [here](https://github.com/hkhcoder/vprofile-project/tree/aws-LiftAndShift)
2. **Create MySQL instance**
   - Tags: 
     - Key = "Name", Value = "vprofile-db01"
     - Key = "Project", Value = "vprofile"
   - Amazon Machine Image, search for **AlmaLinux**, select "AlmaLinux 8 x86_64" image
   -  Instance Type = t2.micro 
   -  Key pair = "vprofile-prod-key" as per above. 
   -  Network settings
      -  Select existing security group 
         -  "vprofile-backend-SG"

     - Go to *Advanced details* and paste the content of the script that you copy from the cloned repo inside **userdata** folder, named **"tomcat_ubuntu.sh"** and paste it under "User data - *optional*" field.
    
**Note**: Tomcat server is running on ubuntu, its security group is **"vprofile-app-SG"** and its service name is called **tomcat9**

To retrieve any instance user data in order to verify the scripts, you can paste this URL on your ssh terminal of any connected instance:
*curl* http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data

### Backend services mapping using Route 53 (Private/Public DNS Setup)

#### Creating DNS public zone

To create a public hosted zone using the Route 53 console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/


2. If you're new to Route 53, choose Get started under DNS management.

   If you're already using Route 53, choose Hosted zones in the navigation pane.

3. Choose Create hosted zone.

4. In the Create Hosted Zone pane, enter the name of the domain that you want to route traffic for. You can also optionally enter a comment.

   For information about how to specify characters other than a-z, 0-9, and - (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain names, [see DNS domain name format.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DomainNameFormat.html)

5. For Type, accept the default value of Public Hosted Zone.

6. Choose Create.

7. Create records that specify how you want to route traffic for the domain and subdomains. For more information, see [Working with records.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/rrsets-working-with.html)

8. To use records in the new hosted zone to route traffic for your domain, see the applicable topic:

   - If you're making Route 53 the DNS service for a domain that is registered with another domain registrar, see [Making Amazon Route 53 the DNS service for an existing domain.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html)

   - If the domain is registered with Route 53, see [Adding or changing name servers and glue records for a domain.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-name-servers-glue-records.html)

#### Creating DNS private zone

1. Go to *Route 53* > *Create hosted zone*
2. Domain name
   - "vprofile.com"
3. *Type*, select *Private hosted zone*
4. VPCs to associate with the hosted zone 
   - Region = US East(N.Virginia)
   - VPC ID select that appears. 
   **Note**: you need to select the region where you created your VMs. In my case, it's the above.
5. Hit the *Create hosted zone* button
6. Hit the *Create record* under the **vprofile** private zone.
   
   Record 1
      - Record name
        - "db01"
      - Record type
        - A
      - Value
        - Its private IP Address
      - TTL (seconds)
        - 300
      - Routing policy
        - Simple routing

   Record 1
      - Record name
        - "mc01"
      - Record type
        - A
      - Value
        - Its private IP Address
      - TTL (seconds)
        - 300
      - Routing policy
        - Simple routing

   Record 1
      - Record name
        - "rmq01"
      - Record type
        - A
      - Value
        - Its private IP Address
      - TTL (seconds)
        - 300
      - Routing policy
        - Simple routing

   

**Note**: Tomcat server will be able to resolve to the backend through the, **"application.properties"** file in the userdata folder. Because of that, there is no need to add it to the private DNS.

#### Joining your DNS public zone with your hosting

To join your DNS hosting service with AWS and create an SSL certificate using Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM), go [here](/vprofile-project-aws-LiftAndShift/Creating%20an%20SSL%20Certificate%20in%20AWS.md).

### Build Artifacts

1. Go to *src > main > resources > application.properties* file.
2. Update this file; "*jdbc.url=* **8jdbc:mysql://db01:3306/** *accounts?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull*" to "*jdbc.url=* **jdbc:mysql://db01.vprofile.com:3306/** *accounts?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull*"
   - **Note**: Just make sure your URL doesn't have any gaps. 
3. For Memcache, it will be; *"memcached.active.host=mc01.**vprofile.com**"* 
5. For RabbitMQ, it will be; *"rabbitmq.address=rmq01.**vprofile.com**"*
6. Now to build the artifact, locate the folder you cloned from GitHub *cd* into it. You should see a pom.xml file.
7. Before you proceed you should have Apache Maven version 3 application installed and Java should be version 11
8. When ready execute;  *mvn install*, to build the artifact.
9.  If successful, you'll see newly created folder with a file called *"target/vprofile-v2.war"*.

### Deploy Artifacts

1. Go to *IAM >* scroll down and hit *Create access key > Command Line Interface (CLI)*
2. Check the box at the bottom to accept the risk and hit *Next > Create access key*

   **Note**: never expose your access keys to anyone.
3. Download the key and change the permissions of the key, recommended is chmod "400".
4. Go to your local terminal to log into AWS by running, *"aws configure"*
5. Enter your ID and Secret to continue
6. Run command; *"aws s3 mb s3://your-bucket-name"* to create one.
7. Copy the artifact to the bucket, run; "*aws s3 cp target/vprofile-v2.war s3://your-bucket-name/*"
8. Create a role and give it access permissions to the S3 and then attach it to the "vprofile-app01" instances to upload the file from S3 bucket. 
     - To create a role:
       - Go to *IAM > Roles > keep AWS Service selected*
       - *Use case = EC2* and hit *Next*, search for "AmazonS3FullAccess" policy and hit *Next*
       - *name* = "vprofile-EC2-access-s3" and hit *Create role*.
9.  Go to *EC2 > Instances > vprofile-app01 > Actions > Security > Modify IAM role >* in the drop down select your role and hit the *Update IAM role*.
10.  ssh into the Tomcat server
11.  Run 

         apt update && apt install awscli -y
12. To see if the IAM role that was attached to the EC2 has access permissions to the bucket.
    
         aws s3 ls
13. Run this command to copy the artifact 
    
         aws s3 cp s3://your-bucket-name/vprofile-v2.war /tmp/

## Setup and Verification on the EC2 Instance

1. Stop the Tomcat service 
   
         systemctl stop tomcat9
2. Remove the default install
   
         rm -rf /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/ROOT
3. Copy the new artifact from the */tmp/* folder and rename it; 
   
         cp /tmp/vprofile-v2.war /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/ROOT.war
4. Restart the service
   
         systemctl start tomcat9.service
         ls /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/
5.  Verify the copied file
   
         cat /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/application.properties
